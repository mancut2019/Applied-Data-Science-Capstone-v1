Peer-graded Assignment: Segmenting and Clustering Neighborhoods in Toronto

For this assignment, you will be required to explore and cluster the neighborhoods in Toronto.

SECTION 1
    Start by creating a new Notebook for this assignment.
    Use the Notebook to build the code to scrape the following Wikipedia page, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M, in order to obtain the data that is in the table of postal codes and to transform the data into a pandas dataframe like the one shown below:
    
    SECTION 2
    Now that you have built a dataframe of the postal code of each neighborhood along with the borough name and neighborhood name, in order to utilize the Foursquare location data, we need to get the latitude and the longitude coordinates of each neighborhood. 
    
   SECTION 3
   Explore and cluster the neighborhoods in Toronto. You can decide to work with only boroughs that contain the word Toronto and then replicate the same analysis we did to the New York City data. It is up to you.

Just make sure:

    to add enough Markdown cells to explain what you decided to do and to report any observations you make.
    to generate maps to visualize your neighborhoods and how they cluster together.
